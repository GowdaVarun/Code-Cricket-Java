# Java Even/Odd Cricket Game ðŸŽ®

This repository contains a Java-based interactive game where players compete against the computer in a simulated "Even/Odd" cricket-style game. Through simple user input, this game provides a fun, turn-based experience where users can choose to "Bat" or "Bowl" based on their prediction of whether the sum of a random number (generated by the computer) and their own chosen number is even or odd.

## How to Play

1. **Select Even/Odd**: The game starts by asking if you think the sum of a number you choose and a random number from the computer will be even or odd.
2. **Decision Time**: If your choice matches the outcome, you get to choose whether to "Bat" or "Bowl." Otherwise, the computer will bat.
3. **Gameplay**: Play turns by entering numbers, with random computer-generated numbers displayed each round. The game keeps score and stops when a player "outsmarts" the other by reaching or exceeding the target score.
4. **Winning Condition**: The game checks the score to determine the winner based on the gameplay style (batting/bowling) and announces who won.
